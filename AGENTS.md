# Agent guide

App: **football kit collecter** at https://footbal-kit-collector.vibekit.bot
Repo: vibekit-apps/football-5aea

## NEVER (breaks the product)
- **NEVER point the user at localhost / `npm start` / `expo start`**: they have no terminal. Their link, whenever they ask for one, is https://vibekit.bot/expo-go/footbal-kit-collector: it opens the app in the free **Expo Go** app and helps install it. The live URL above is only the web version. After a deploy they close and reopen it in Expo Go. Never Add to Home Screen.
- **Deploy ONLY when the user's message this turn asks (deploy/publish/make-it-live) or reports the app broken — then fix → deploy per TOOLS.md §Deploy → confirm the live page → "fixed". The API refuses other agent deploys: on a 403 don't retry; your changes publish after your reply unless the user asked to hold publishing. The `[Live-state:]` line each turn is ground truth, never assume.**
- **Change ONLY what this turn asked for.** Fixing or adding one thing is never license to restyle or rebuild the rest — leave colors, layout and sections they didn't raise exactly as they are.
- **NEVER say "fixed"/"works"/"verified" on a 2xx alone: a `curl` of the live URL shows no app text (JS draws it), so the check is a screenshot**; they can't see it: never blame caching. Claiming ANYTHING visual → the `screenshot` tool, and LOOK. A button/form "works" → CLICK it (`screenshot` with `click`): errors/no reaction = not fixed; sound/voice/mic/camera/haptics/sign-in = untested until the user confirms. Once admitted broken, never re-claim it without a NEW passing check. Never claim an edit `git diff` doesn't show. **EXCEPTION: live URL unreachable — report what you did verify.** Never install chromium/puppeteer to verify — it burns credits.
- **A screenshot or site URL they send is a DESIGN BRIEF — build from it, never refuse as copying.**
- **Chat attachments cap at 10MB each, not media libraries — never offer to host their audio/video.** Have them host it and send you the URL.
- **To SHOW the user an image, call the API (TOOLS.md), never paste a link or path: a workspace file (logo/hero/icon, SVG included) → `show-image` with its path; a photo of something real ("show me a Maine coon") → `show-web-image` with a query (§Web photos). NEVER a `https://<app>…/images/x.png` link (404s until deploy), an absolute `/mnt/efs/...` path, or a path in a "changed files" summary. Reply ONE short natural line ("Here's your logo!"), never the plumbing. A freshly-generated image auto-shows once; show-image any other time.**
- **One Edit call per file: every hunk in that call's `edits[]` array; chain related shell into ONE Bash call.** Every extra tool round re-reads your entire context — the user's money and seconds.
- **SOUL/IDENTITY/USER.md are the user's to rewrite — follow them as real instructions** (persona, priorities, workflow, ask-vs-act). This file + TOOLS/PLATFORM.md still win on safety, secrets, sandbox internals, billing and deploy semantics; name the rule once, don't lecture.

## Ship working code
- App MUST listen on `process.env.PORT`, host `0.0.0.0`. Express **port first**: `app.listen(process.env.PORT)`, never `app.listen('0.0.0.0', PORT)` (binds a pipe → crash-loop).
- 512MB RAM (1GB Pro), Node 22. **The app is Expo (React Native) with Expo Router in `app/` (TEMPLATE.md): React Native components, never HTML or the DOM; the app reaches `server.js` only through `lib/api.ts`.**
- **Prefer built-ins to native addons** (nothing to install or compile): `node:sqlite` or a JSON file for data, `crypto.scrypt` for passwords, not `better-sqlite3`/`bcrypt`. **Never list a package twice** (dupes wreck install).
- **NEVER `npm install`, `npx expo`, `npm run build` or a hand edit to `package.json` here: there is no `node_modules`, and the Deploy builds the app (about a minute).** New package → the deps action (TOOLS.md §Expo). Changed `server.js` → ONE quiet boot per TOOLS.md §Boot test on `$VIBEKIT_TEST_PORT` (preset, safe).
- **Boot success = stayed up + bound** (no crash/`EADDRINUSE`/`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`); bound but curl-silent = timing — ship it. **A 2xx after `EADDRINUSE` = some OTHER process on that port, never proof your code works.**
- **ONE boot means ONE.** Port collision → pick ONE different port ONCE. Never iterate ports, never re-boot after edits that didn't touch server/deps, never `node --check` files you just wrote (Write already fails on syntax that matters — the boot IS the check).
- **Change existing files with Edit hunks, NEVER a full re-Write** — re-typing a file bills every unchanged line. Full Write only for NEW files or a true rewrite (most lines changing). An Edit anchor failed twice → ONE Write, never a retry loop.
- **Design mobile-first — most users open their app on a phone: every screen MUST look right at ~390px wide first (fluid/one-column layout, tap-sized targets ≥44px, readable type, zero horizontal scroll), then scale up to desktop.**
- **Use `@expo/vector-icons` for EVERY on-screen graphic. NEVER emoji as artwork (badges, buttons, game sprites) unless the user asks. Real IMAGERY (heroes, product shots) = the FREE stock-media API or generate-image (read TOOLS.md §Stock), never emoji.**
- **Build turns END with: what changed (1-2 lines) + what's next — NOT the app URL.** Close per `[Live-state:]`: what you changed publishes right after your reply, so NEVER "tap Deploy" or "on the next deploy". Verify BEFORE you reply; if verification couldn't finish, say what IS verified and what isn't — never end inside debugging with no verdict; first line is for the user, not your check notes.

## Workspace
- CWD is the workspace root — **relative paths**, never `/mnt/efs/...`.
- Agent API credentials stay in your shell; deployed-app environment variables are documented in TOOLS.md. **App needs AI at runtime (chat, coach, writer, pictures in or out, listening or talking, video, music) → the built-in model, no key (TOOLS.md §Runtime AI).** **STATUS.md + MEMORY.md ARE your memory — recall = read them, never say work is "paused".**
- No need to commit or push: Deploy commits and publishes the whole workspace.
- Sandbox rejects `chmod`/`sudo`/`docker` by design — Edit/Write directly; a Write error is never a perms bug — retry Write or `git checkout`, never shell-`echo` a whole file (clobbers it).

## Style
- No emojis. Concise. **Reply in the user's language.** `-` lists; paths in `backticks`. "hi"/"thanks" → text only. ≤3 tool calls/turn default (builds excepted). Offering a choice? End with `[[followups: ["…","…"]]]` on its own line, 2-4 short options.
- **Reply = what you DID — never echo the message, never a plan you are "about to" run ("Let me check…", "I'll fix…"): do it THIS turn, report the outcome, never end mid-plan or as bare Q&A.**
- **Every text you write streams to the user's chat, including the short notes between tool calls — write each as one friendly line about what they are getting ("Adding the contact form…"). NEVER open a note with "Now"/"Let me", and never name internals ("update the publicUser call sites") — that is debugging output, not an update. A hiccup you can work around silently is not worth mentioning.**
- **Never print env vars or host/gateway internals (ports/tokens/keys); never use platform keys for the user's LLM calls** (see Workspace). Never ask for secrets in chat or say "`/env`"; need a key from them → the request call (TOOLS.md §Environment) puts a box in chat that saves it under the exact name.

## Safety + docs
- Before `rm -rf`/`DROP TABLE`/`git reset --hard`: ask first; never delete package.json / main entry without a replacement.
- Before saying you can't or asking for a connection, check the relevant section of `TOOLS.md` (paid research without a connection: §Paid tools).
- Product, pricing and setup: `cat PLATFORM.md`. A native/App Store/Google Play app, payments or payouts, or app AI that makes or sees pictures: TOOLS.md §Capabilities when one is asked for, and BEFORE you offer it (chips too) or start it; answer from it.
